            <h2>Working Hours</h2>

            <p>Contractual working hours are 8 hours per day, with a 30-minute lunch break. In Kodeworks, we operate with a core time in the period 9-15, with the opportunity and room to be able to be flexible during working hours. In a company where competence is our main product, we know that working closely with our colleagues will give the best results. We also know that everyday life can offer other things that mean that at times you need to adapt your working hours outside the core hours.</p>

            <p>As consultants, we must nevertheless take into account that our customers have their own core time, and any changes here you must coordinate with your project and/or your human resources manager.</p>

            <h3>Vacation</h3>

            <p>We use the regular 5-week paid vacation.</p>

            <p>It is often the case that the project you are on wants you to take the holiday at certain times, typically the joint holiday, Easter, Christmas, autumn/winter holiday overlapping with school/kindergarten, etc. We try to adapt to this, but understand that it is not always doable.</p>

            <p>When you go on holiday, just follow this checklist:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Report to the nearest manager</li>
              <li>Talk to the customer to get it cleared</li>
              <li>Put it in the calendar</li>
              <li>Enter it in the timekeeping system</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We follow the Norwegian legislation and Tekna'a definition of Norwegian holidays. For instance, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve are ordinary working days.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="handbok-arbeidssted">
            <h2>Workplace</h2>
            <p>As a consultant, it often happens that we work where the customer is located. We at Kodeworks aim to find assignments that are not too far from the ordinary workplace.</p>

            <p>Kodeworks will cover travel expenses for assignments that entail greater costs and a significantly longer journey than to a normal workplace.</p>

            <p>For example, this will be with longer assignments outside zone A in Trondheim or zone 1 in Oslo.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="handbok-betingelser">
            <h2>Conditions</h2>

            <p>We want all our employees to feel as good as possible at work by offering the necessary freedom, security and stability in everyday life. At the same time, it is also important to get the tools you need to be able to do your job in the best possible way.</p>

            <h3>Salary</h3>

            <p>At Kodeworks, we do not want the salary to be a factor you have to think about. At the same time, it is important to have a good salary in order to have the freedom and stability we want all our employees to have. Therefore, have no individual salary assessments. As an employee, you should not have to ask for what you deserve. It should come automatically. We have chosen a salary model that gives everyone equal pay mainly based on the number of years of experience. All Kodeworks employees have an overview of what the others earn. An overview of the current salary level and background figures for salary adjustment can be found in the "Lønn" folder on Google Drive.</p>

            <p>Salary is usually paid on the 22nd of each month, or the last business day before if the 22nd is not a business day.</p>

            <h3>Holiday Pay</h3>

            <p>Holiday pay is paid in June. All 25 vacation days will be deducted this month. June usually does not have 25 working days, so the remaining vacation days are deducted correspondingly from the holiday pay. Employees who have started working during the current year will not have any accrued holiday pay, and will be deducted the remainder of the vacation day deduction in the following month (so that there will be a 25-day deduction in total). If you want to be paid the holiday pay at another time, this can be done by agreement with the accounting department. For practical reasons, it is a good idea to notify this in good time before you want payment.</p>

            <h3>Overtime and Overtime Allowance</h3>

            <p>From time to time you may need to work a few extra hours a week. This mainly applies for hectic periods during a project a customer project. Beyond this, it is desirable to keep overtime work to a minimum. We believe that the employee's free time should be respected and that you would rather perform better the hours you are at work if you have had sufficient rest. Therefore, you decide completely if you want to work overtime.</p>

            <p>The overtime pay can be calculated by dividing the annual salary by 1950 hours, and then adding 40%.</p>

            <p>Overtime work must always be clarified with the personnel manager first unless otherwise agreed.</p>


            <h3>Pension and Insurance</h3>

            <p>Kodeworks sets aside 7% in pension savings. This applies from 0 to 12G.</p>

            <p>In addition to regular business travel and occupational injury insurance, we have travel insurance that covers leisure travel for you and your family. We also have treatment insurance that ensures that you get fast and good treatment if something should happen. This also includes free access to doctor's appointments on mobile.</p>

            <p>We use Gjensidige for both pension and insurance, and each employee can log in to Gjensidige and see their profile and details about this. A short guide on how to get an overview of your own insurance in Gjensidige can be found in the "Forsikring" folder on Google Drive.</p>

            <h3>Computer and Software</h3>

            <p>We cover the computer and software you need to do your job. What you choose is up to you. Kodeworks\' laptop fleet now includes Dell XPS 15, MacBook Pro and Christian's gaming laptop. If at some point the computer is not good enough to do the work tasks as efficiently as possible, it's time for a new one.</p>

            <p>If you need software to do your job, such as IDEA, you can buy this directly and register an expense in our accounting system.</p>

            <h3>Literature and Other Learning Materials</h3>

            <p>There are countless sources to help quench the thirst for knowledge. If you want to take advantage of e-learning offers such as Pluralsight, Coursera or similar, just sign up for this. You are also free to buy books in all shapes and forms. After all, it is knowledge we live by! Register the expense in our accounting system, so that you can be reimbursed.</p>

            <h3>Courses and Conferences</h3>

            <p>Kodeworks encourages you to attend courses and conferences. In 2018, we all went to JavaZone, but it is to be expected that the employees' interests and wishes for professional replenishment can best be satisfied in other places as well. If you want to go to courses or conferences several times a year, or to go to places that entail greater costs than, for example, JavaZone, this requires the approval of the human resources manager.</p>

            <p>If you contribute to giving lectures, courses or the like, Kodeworks will cover this within reasonable limits.</p>

            <h3>Health</h3>

            <p>Our occupational group is very exposed to stress-related injuries, which can be avoided by facilitating a good physical work environment. If you're working from a customers offices, and feel that – for example – a table, screen or chair is not good enough, we will make sure to improve this. It should not be necessary to let such things go at the expense of health.</p>

            <p>We also want to make arrangements for you to be physically active. In Trondheim, Kodeworks has a corporate agreement with 3T. Here, several Kodeworks employees play weekly squash. You do not need to use this if you want to train elsewhere. We cover a similar subscription with other providers as well. In Oslo, there is no separate company agreement, so there you just have to find a similar subscription and we will reimburse it.</p>

            <h3>Benefits</h3>

            <p>In order for you as an employee to have a flexible, safe and predictable everyday life, Kodeworks has a number of benefits. With the exception of benefits that are to be entered in the time registration system, such as parental leave and care leave, expenses for everything else are registered as employee expenses and will be reimbursed on the next salary payment.</p>

            <p>Periodic expenses such as broadband and membership at the fitness center must be registered monthly. In the event of varying expenses, it is your responsibility as an employee not to exceed 12 times the maximum monthly amount for the relevant benefit in the current year.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Mobile phone + subscription.</li>
              <li>Broadband is covered by up to NOK 500 per month.</li>
              <li>Membership with 3T (Trondheim) is covered through our corporate agreement, or a corresponding subscription with other providers (Oslo & Trondheim).</li>
              <li>Other necessary electronics to perform the work, for example mobile phone, computer monitor, or mouse.</li>
              <li>2 weeks paid leave at child birth.</li>
              <li>Full pay during parental leave.</li>
            </ul>



            <h3>Welfare Leave</h3>
            <p>In order to help make both planned and unforeseen events in everyday life a little easier to handle, Kodeworks provides the following welfare benefits in addition to what is required by law:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Examination by a doctor or dentist.</li>
              <li>Accompany children to the first day of school or kindergarten (up to 1 day).</li>
              <li>Leave for the rest of the working day if you become ill during the day and have to leave the workplace.</li>
              <li>Short leave due to illness in the home.</li>
              <li>Short leave when spouse/cohabitant/partner is about to give birth.</li>
              <li>Deaths and funerals for close relatives (up to 5 days).</li>
              <li>To donate blood.</li>
              <li>Relocation (up to 1 day a year).</li>
              <li>Wedding (up to 1 day).</li>
              <li>Driver's license exam.</li>
            </ul>

          <article id="handbok-timeforing">
            <h2>Timekeeping</h2>

            <p>Timekeeping is unfortunately required in most consulting companies, and Kodeworks is no exception. Fortunately, like most other consulting companies, we have created our own timekeeping tool to make the process easier. In the timekeeping tool, you enter work-related time, i.e. billable time on various projects, illness, vacation, leave, etc. The hours are delivered by the last working day of the month.</p>

            <p>A working day in the timekeeping tool is 8 hours. This means that holidays, welfare leave and internal initiatives must be taken with 8 hours per day. For customer projects, it will usually be 7.5 hours, unless the contract indicates that we invoice the lunch break as well. You will be informed of this before the project starts.</p>

            <p>You may also have to keep hours in the customer's own system. There will probably be other rules for when and how this is to be done.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="handbok-medeier">
            <h2>Co-Owner</h2>

            <p>The position also facilitates that employees can become co-owners. We believe that employees who have co-ownership get stronger incentives to create growth and well-being in the company, which benefits everyone. Co-ownership will be distributed from a pool of shares owned by the company or parent company. The shares are bought and sold at cost price. Upon share purchase, the employee joins the company's shareholder agreement.</p>

            <p>All employees will be offered shares after they have been hired as consultants for three months. Since this requires some administration and signatures of all existing shareholders, we do this every six months (June 1 and December 1). We recommend everyone to read up on the topic before the process begins, but we will also try to answer all questions to the best of our ability.</p>

            <p>Most of our daily communications are on Slack, our preferred platform. Here you'll find a relaxed vibe. This is where you'll find everyone if you want to initiate a social gathering, like an after work beverage, a game of squash, or a bit of Fortnite.</p>

            <p>If you need to be a bit more formal we recommend using email.</p>

            <p>Work related communications should be kept to normal business hours.</p>
